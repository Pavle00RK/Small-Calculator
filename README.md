# Small-Calculator

This is a simple calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It features two input fields for entering numbers, each with an eraser icon to clear its content individually. Once both inputs are filled, clicking on an arithmetic operation button displays the result. Additionally, an eraser icon next to the result field allows users to clear the output. The interface is color-coded for better usability, making calculations quick and intuitive.
